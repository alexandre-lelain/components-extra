# FAQ

## Can I use material-ui's library along with components-extra ?

Yeah, totally. [@material-ui/core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-ui/core) is a dependency of **components-extra**. So if you
want to use some components from their library, **you don't even need to install it** aside in your *dependencies*' list.

When doing imports like:

```jsx
import { Typography } from '@material-ui/core';
```

Your bundler will automatically look for *@material-ui/core* package in **components-extra** node module.

## What if I want to use a specific version of @material-ui/core ?

Well, in that case, you can totally install the version of **@material-ui/core** you need in your dependencies' list. The styles of the version
you have installed will overwrite the ones from **components-extra**.

## How to use components-extra with Gatsby.js ?

All components of **components-extra** are Server-Side-Rendering friendly, so you can totaly integrate them
in your SSR app.

If you are using the awesome framework [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) (if you are not, you should definitely try it!), you will need to add
two plugins in your `gatsby-config.js` file to make **components-extra** work smoothly:

- [gatsby-plugin-styled-components](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-styled-components/)
- [gatsby-plugin-material-ui](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-material-ui/)

> Note: Those are not required to make your app compile correctly, however you might experience some display issues if you don't
use them.
