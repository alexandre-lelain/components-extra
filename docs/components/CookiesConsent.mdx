# CookiesConsent

<br />

- [CookiesConsent](#)
  - [CookiesConsent.Category](#cookiesconsentcategory)
  - [CookiesConsent.Controls](#cookiesconsentcontrols)
    - [CookiesConsent.Button](#cookiesconsentbutton)

On desktop screens, the description of the category will be displayed next to the title. On small screens, it will be displayed inside the content of the accordion.

You can append any content to each `<CookiesConsent.Category>`, meaning you can bring
your own table component, or a list, or even a simple paragraph. Here, the `Table` component
is not included in `<CookiesConsent>`, it is a separate component for the sake of the demo.

> **Note:** By default, the Categories are uncontrolled. But you can also chose to control them with a *[checked, onChange]* set of props.
