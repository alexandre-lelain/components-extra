<p>Thank you for using components-extra ❤. Here you will learn how to set up in 2 minutes the lib inside your app.</p>

## Get started

### Prerequisites

Before anything, please make you to have the three following packages installed:

- [react >= 16.8.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)
- [react-dom >= 16.8.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)
- [styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components)

### Step 1

**components-extra** relies on both [material-ui theme](https://material-ui.com/customization/theming/) configuration
as well as the [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced) theming system.

The first step consists into wrapping your web application in **components-extra**'s default theme provider `<StyledProvider>`:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { StyledProvider } from 'components-extra'

const App = () => {

  return (
    <StyledProvider>
      <p>Simple, is it not ?</p>
    </StyledProvider>
  )
}
```

> **Note:** The `StyledProvider` will forward the **theme** object to all the children recursively. Not using this Provider above the other components will result in an JS error,
and you will not be able to use not access the theme.


### Step 2

Import the component you want to use. For example, the `<BackToTop>` button:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { BackToTop, StyledProvider } from 'components-extra'

const App = () => {

  return (
    <StyledProvider>
      <BackToTop />
    </StyledProvider>
  )
}
```

And voilà! you're all set and ready to create your website's interface.

## Fonts

Like **Material-UI**, the components all use **[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)** font-familly as their main option,
but it is not included in **components-extra** to provide more freedom to the developers.

You have to manually use the following CDN link to include the Roboto font in your application:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap" />
```

> **Note:** adding this `stylesheet` in the `<head>` of your page will fetch it in a synchronous way.
There are [multiple techniques](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/load-css-simpler) to fetch it asynchronously to improve the performances of your app.
