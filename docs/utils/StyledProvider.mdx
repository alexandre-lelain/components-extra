# StyledProvider

<br />

This is the `Provider` responsible for forwarding the `theme` recursively to all its children.
You don't necessarily need to use it at the root of your App - you just need to make sure to
wrap all the components from **components-extra** in it:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { BackToTop, StyledProvider } from 'components-extra'

const YourApp = () => {

  return (
    <YourContainer>
      <SomeComponent />
      <AnotherComponentOfYours/>
      ...
      <StyledProvider>
        <BackToTop />
      </StyledProvider>
    </YourContainer>
  )
}
```

> **Note:** However, it's highly recommended to put the `<StyledProvider>` at the root of your App to avoid useless re-renders caused by the
parents of the component where you implement it.

If you don't put this `Provider` on top of the components, the `theme` will be undefined and it will result in a JS error on runtime.
