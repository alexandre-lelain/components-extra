# BackToTop

This is the component you can see at the bottom-right corner of your window when you scroll down. Its default behavior doesn't
require any prop, so you can use it straight of the box. It will appear automatically on the bottom-right corner when the page is scrolled,
and it will scroll back smoothly to the top of the page when you click on it.

You can cutomize the height from which the Button will apear upon scrolling by overriding the `mixins.backToTop.startHeight` property from the **theme**.

> **Note:** clicking on the button in the stories will bring you back to the top of the window ;)

## Default

This component extends Material's UI `<Fab>` component so you can use all its props. Check out its [Api](https://material-ui.com/api/fab/). It doesn't require any other prop.
