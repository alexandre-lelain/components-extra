## Get started

### Prerequisites

Before anything, please make sure to have the three following packages installed:

- [react >= 16.8.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)
- [react-dom >= 16.8.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)
- [styled-components >= 5.0.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components)
- [@material-ui/core >= 4.0.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@material-ui/core)

### Step 1

**components-extra** relies on both [Material-UI's theme](https://material-ui.com/customization/theming/) configuration
as well as the [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced) theming system.

The first step consists into wrapping your web application in **components-extra**'s default theme provider `<StyledProvider>`:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { StyledProvider } from 'components-extra'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <StyledProvider>
      <p>Simple, is it not ?</p>
    </StyledProvider>
  )
}
```

> **Note:** The `StyledProvider` will forward the **theme** object to all the children recursively. Not using this Provider above the other components will result in an JS error, and you will not be able to access the theme.

### Step 2

Import the component you want to use. For example, the `<BackToTop>` button:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { BackToTop, StyledProvider } from 'components-extra'

const App = () => {
  return (
    <StyledProvider>
      <BackToTop />
    </StyledProvider>
  )
}
```

And voil√†! you're all set and ready to create your website's interface.

## Fonts

Like **Material-UI**, the components all use **[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)** font-familly as their main option,
but it is not included in **components-extra** to provide more freedom to the developers.

You have to manually use the following CDN link to include the Roboto font in your application:

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap"
/>
```

> **Note:** adding this `stylesheet` in the `<head>` of your page will fetch it in a synchronous way. There are [multiple techniques](https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/load-css-simpler) to fetch it asynchronously to improve the performances of your app.
