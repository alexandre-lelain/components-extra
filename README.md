## Motivation

Do you have a web application to develop as soon as possible ? Are you tired of duplicating components such as a Navbar or a CookiesBanner across all your applications ?
Do you want to use [material-design](material.io/design/) standards ?

Well, you are in the right place. This lib was made **just** for **you**.

The aim of the project is to provide fast-to-use **molecule** components (like a Navbar, a CookiesBanner, and so on) built on top of material-ui components & standards.

The components are built under the [compound pattern](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/compound-components-with-react-hooks) with this very simple purpose: **save you time**. They focus
on what they were made for. They have very few props so you can integrate them **right-away** as they all have
a built-in default behavior.

The compound pattern allows you to customize easily any single inner component of a molecule component, and
you can bring your own **theme** to customize them with your own styleguide.

## UI components

[Cick here](https://components-extra.netlify.com) to see the list of available components the lib has to offer. To see the API of each component, simply visit their `API` story on the storybook. You can also see the **source code** of each story by clicking the "**show info**" button on the
top-right corner. The source code examples will help you to integrate the components easily.


## Requirements

In order for the lib to be the smallest possible, the three following dependencies are externals to the lib.
So you will need to have those three installed on your app:

- **[react > 16.8.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react)**
- **[react-dom > 16.8.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom)**
- **[styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/styled-components)**

## Installation

```shell
yarn add components-extra
```

or

```shell
npm -i components-extra
```

Some more good news: This library is **tree-shakeable** and **side-effect free**! It also supports older builds like cjs and umd if needed.

### Fonts

Like Material-UI, the components all use **[Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)** font-familly as their main option, but it is not included in **components-extra** to provide more freedom to the developers.

You have to manually use the following CDN link to include the Roboto font in your application:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Roboto:300,400,500,700&display=swap" />
```

## Getting started in only 2 steps

### Step 1

**components-extra** relies on both [material-ui theme](https://material-ui.com/customization/theming/) configuration
as well as the [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/advanced) theming system.

So the first step consists into wrapping your web application in **components-extra**'s default theme provider `<StyledProvider>`:

```js
import { StyledProvider } from 'components-extra'

const App = () => {

  return (
    <StyledProvider>
      <p>Simple, is it not ?</p>
    </StyledProvider>
  )
}
```

Doing so will forward the **theme** object to all the children recursively. Not using this Provider above
the other components will result in an JS error.

### Step 2

Import the component you want to use. For example, the `BackToTop` button:

```js
import { BackToTop, StyledProvider } from 'components-extra'

const App = () => {

  return (
    <StyledProvider>
      <BackToTop />
    </StyledProvider>
  )
}
```

And voilÃ ! You're all set and ready to create your website's interface.

## Customization

You can totally override the default **theme**. By default, the components use the
following [custom theme](https://components-extra.netlify.com/?path=/story/introduction-default-theme--values).
This default theme is applied on top of the [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/customization/theming/) one.

You can override this theme with the prop `theme` of the `StyledProvider` component
mentionned above.

Say, for example, you want to override the 2 main palette colors to have this:

```js
// YourTheme.js
export default {
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#0000cc',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#ff471a',
    },
  },
}
```

You can apply it this way:

```js
// index.js
import { BackToTop, StyledProvider } from 'components-extra'
import yourTheme from './YourTheme'

const App = () => {

  return (
    <StyledProvider theme={yourTheme}>
      <BackToTop />
    </StyledProvider>
  )
}
```

### Extend the components

All the **components-extra** are exported as [styled-components](styled-components.com), so you can extend them, and
use them as styled selectors.


For example, to extend the **BackToTop** component:

```js
import { BackToTop, StyledProvider } from 'components-extra'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const CustomBackToTop = styled(BackToTop)`
  opacity: 0.5;
`

const App = () => {

  return (
    <StyledProvider>
      <CustomBackToTop />
    </StyledProvider>
  )
}
```

Or to use it as a styled selector:

```js
import { BackToTop, StyledProvider } from 'components-extra'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const Container = styled.div`
  ${BackToTop} {
    opacity: 0.5;
  }
`

const App = () => {

  return (
    <StyledProvider>
      <Container>
        <BackToTop />
      </Container>
    </StyledProvider>
  )
}
```

## Bundling in your project

**components-extra** is tree-shakeable, meaning that you can import its components as named imports, like this:

```
import { BackToTop } from 'components-extra'
```

If your bundler is set up to use the tree-shakeable libraries, it will automatically **only add the named imports
you used**. In this example, only the `BackToTop` button will be included in your bundle.

Else, if your bundler is not set up to use **esm/es** builds, you can still only include the components you need
by importing them as defaults like this:

```
import BackToTop from 'components-extra/BackToTop'
```

## Contributing

Do you have a component you would like to add in the library ? Please, open an issue and/or
a PR! :)

Do you want to fix a broken feature ? Please, go ahead :)

Any ideas, suggestions ? Feel free to open an issue!

If you open a PR, please run the following command to ensure your code meets the lint config, that it builds correctly, and that it meets the linter set up rules. Your code will be prettier-ed automatically when you commit thanks to a pre-commit hook.

```
yarn validate
```


If one component's test function doesn't make sense anymore with your changes, don't hesitate to update
its source code accordingly. Tests are here to make sure no regression happens and that the components' DOM
reflects their specification. There also are some functional tests to make sure the components behave
as expected.
